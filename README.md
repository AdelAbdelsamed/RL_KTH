# Reinforcement Learning - EL2705 (Autumn 2023)

Repository for the Reinforcement Learning (RL) coursework. This repository contains the laboratory code and resources for the course homework for the EL2705 course at KTH in the autumn term of 2023. This repository is made with collaboration with Alexander Weers.

## Course Overview

This coursework consists of two homework assignments and two laboratory work.

### Homework Assignments

1. **Homework 1 - MDP and Optimal Stopping**
   - Written Tasks on Modelling using Markov Decision Processes and Optimal Stopping based on Bellman's Equations.

3. **Homework 2 - Q-Learning, SARSA, Policy Gradient and Function Approximation**
   - Written Tasks on Tabular Q-learning, Tabular Sarsa, Policy Parameterization in Policy Gradient and theoretical questions in Function Approximation.

### Laboratory Work

In addition to the homework assignments, the Laboratory work including the bonus assignments entails:

- **Lab 1**
   - The Maze and the Random Minotaur (Mandatory)
        - Tasks included modelling the Gridworld problem and variations using MDPS and                 implementing solutions using Dynamic Programming, Value Iteration, SARSA and Q-              Learning.
   - RL with Linear Function Approximation (Bonus)
        - Task utilized the MountainCar Environment provided by OpenGym library to implement           SARSA(lambda) with linear function approximation using Fourer Basis as                       feature functions.
      
- **Lab 2**
   - Deep Q-Networks (DQN) (Mandatory)
        - Task utilized the LunarLander-v2 from the OpenGym library to implement Episodic              DQN with epsilon-greedy exploration and explored the Dueling DQN modification.
   - Deep Determnistic Policy Gradient (DDPG) (Bonus)
        - Task utiized the LunarLanderContinuous-v2 from the OpenGym library to implement              the off-policy model-free RL agorithm DDPG.
   - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Bonus)
        - Task utilized the LunarLanderContinuous-v2 from the OpenGym library to implement             the stochastic counterpart to DDPG, PPO.
